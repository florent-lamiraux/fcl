fcl::Vec3f has been replaced by Eigen::Matrix <FCL_REAL, 3, 3>. For
compatibility, the type fcl::Vec3f is still provided. However, the following
modifications should be done in client code:

  - fcl::Vec3f::length should be replaced by fcl::Vec3f::norm,
  - fcl::Vec3f::sqrLength should be replaced by fcl::Vec3f::squaredNorm,
  - fcl::Vec3f::equal should be replaced by fcl::Vec3f::operator==,
  - fcl::Matrix3f cosntructor with 9 values should replaced by
    fcl::Matrix3f::operator<<,
  - fcl::Matrix3f::TransposeDotX should be replaced by
    fcl::Matrix3f::col (0).dot
  - fcl::Matrix3f::TransposeDotY should be replaced by
    fcl::Matrix3f::col (1).dot
  - fcl::Matrix3f::TransposeDotY should be replaced by
    fcl::Matrix3f::col (2).dot
  - fcl::Matrix3f::getColumn should be replaced by fcl::Matrix3f::col,
  - fcl::Matrix3f::getRow should be replaced by fcl::Matrix3f::row,
  - fcl::Vec3f::setValue (const FCL_REAL&) should be replaced by
    fcl::Vec3f::setConstant,
  - method Matrix3f::setEulerZYX (FCL_REAL, FCL_REAL, FCL_REAL) has been
    replaced by a function setEulerZYX (FCL_REAL, FCL_REAL, FCL_REAL, Matrix3f&)
